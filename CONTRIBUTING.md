## Contribute

At this early stage there are two primary developers of TextSecure iOS and as we move from the early stages to more advanced ones opportunities will abound to contribute to the core code base. We are particularly interested in support and contributions associated localization, code review, and automated testing. Please contact us.

## Code Conventions

We are trying to follow the [GitHub code conventions for Objective-C](https://github.com/github/objective-c-conventions) and we would really appreciate that pull requests do conform with those conventions. 

In addition to that, always add curly braces to your `if` conditionals, even if there is no `else`.

One note, for programmers joining us from Java or similar language communities, note that [exceptions are not commonly used for errors that may occur in normal use](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/324284/throwing-an-exception-in-objective-c-cocoa/324805#324805) so familiarize yourself with **NSError** 

## BitHub

Open Whisper Systems is currently [experimenting](https://whispersystems.org/blog/bithub/) with the funding privacy Free and Open Source software. Payements are opt-in for the `TextSecure-iOS` repo and can be enabled by adding `MONEYMONEY` in a commit message string.
